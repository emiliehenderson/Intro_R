## Getting help.

If you know what function you want, but  don't know how to use it, the help function is helpful.

```{r}
help(help)
```


There's also a shortcut, just '?'
```{r}
?help
```


If you don't quite know the name of the function you want, help.search, or just '??' use keywords and fuzzy matching to give you a list of possibilities.

```{r}
??help
```


When you don't know enough to ask for help via R's help, just go to Google.  Discussion boards, blogs and help files online are abundant! Stackoverflow is a great resource. 

The folks at CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network) also maintain 'task views' that are useful road-maps to help you figure out what R packages are useful for a particular task, or field.

Because R is constantly under development, new packages come online all the time.  It's well worth checking in.  Here is a link to the 'spatial' task view: https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html.


## Navigating around the filing system.
You can find your current working directory with `getwd()`.

```{r}
getwd()
```


Note: R thinks like Unix.  use "\\\\" or "/", rather than "\\" for filepaths.  Unless you're a native UNIX speaker, this quirk probably will trip you up at some point in time.

You can set your current working directory to help keep your files organized. 

```{r}
# setwd("C:/temp/GISWorkshop") 
# note: This assumes you have a drive called "D" and a folder at that path. If you don't, this code chunk will fail. I commented out the code to allow it to run for me. - Aaron
# Good catch. Changing to C:/temp/GISWorkshop for now.  Do you mind creating the local temp directory where you're working so that you can run this?

# I do think we should keep this segment as working directories are crucial to understand.
```


You can view the objects in your current workspace, the files in your current working directory, or the files present in other folders on your computer. 

```{r}
ls()
list.files()
list.files("C:/temp")
```


## Data Structures: Base-R and tidyverse
Basic R stores data and information in four major object types: vectors, matrices, data frames and lists.

The R package-set `tidyverse` is "an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures." The textbook by the main author of the packages, Hadley Wickham, is available online here <http://r4ds.had.co.nz/>, or through O'Reilly Publishing in paper form. 

### Base-R

#### Vectors
Vectors can old a single number or character, or a sequence of numbers or characters.  They are essentially a 1-dimensional structure for holding information.  All pieces of information within a single vector are of the same data type.  In other words, a single vector will contain either only integers, or all characters.  Numbers that stored in a character vector work like characters.

Vectors are created by using the 'c()' function. 

```{r}
##### numeric vector creation
myvector <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
print(myvector)

##### character vector creation
myvector<-c("a","b","c","d","e")
print(myvector)
```


It is possible to access subsets of a given vector with a numeric index indicating the position of the things you want.  The ':' character can be used to specify a range of values.  You can also use a vector of integers to subset another vector.

```{r}
#### vector subsetting
print(myvector[1])
print(myvector[2])     
print(myvector[3:5])    
print(myvector[c(1,3,5)])   
```


#### Matrices

Matrices are a lot like vectors, but in two dimensions.  They contain rows, and columns, and data that are all of one type. 

```{r}
myvector<-c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
mymatrix<-matrix(myvector, byrow = T, nrow = 3)
print(mymatrix)
```


Matrix subsets can also be accessed by providing indices within square brackets, just like vectors, but with two dimensions rather than one (rows come first).

```{r}
print(mymatrix[1:2,2:3])
```


#### Data Frames, with a digression to address Factor vectors

Data frames, like matrices, are also 2-dimensional data structures.  Unlike matrices, they can hold data of different types (characters and numbers) in separate columns.


```{r}
mydataframe<-data.frame(x=1:9,y = letters[1:9])
print(mydataframe)
```


R, by default, stores the character column as a factor ('fctr'). This is a third type of data that we have not yet introduced.  Factors store text, or 'string' data as numbers, which you cannot see when the data are printed to the console. Yes, this is confusing.  It is, however, space efficient for storage.  In order to save space, when R detects text in a data frame, it generates an integer index for each unique text string, and then uses that integer to point to the appropriate text to print.

> In the `tidyverse` packages, some changes have been made to how R determines what is or isn't a factor. Traditionally, you have to specify `stringsAsFactors=FALSE` when reading in data if you want to tell R to treat characters as characters and not as factors. `tidyverse` has changed the default behavior to never read in character vectors as factors, and instead allow the user to determine when something should be a factor by using `as.factor()` or `factor()`. 


```{r}
mydataframe<-data.frame(colors = c("red","red","green","blue"), pets =c("cat","dog","bird","dog"))
print(mydataframe)
```


Each column in this data frame is stored as a factor, which means that this is really a table full of invisible numbers.

```{r}
print(as.numeric(mydataframe$colors))
print(as.numeric(mydataframe$pets))
```


Those numbers point to the 'levels' of the factor variable.

```{r}
print(levels(mydataframe$colors))
print(levels(mydataframe$pets))
```


For the 'colors' factor vector, the number three points to the color 'red'.  For the 'pets' factor vector, the number three points to 'dog'.

While there are many good things about factors, odds are good that these invisible numbers will trip you up at least once in your R programming career.  Consider yourself warned.

> It's a good practice to coerce the column of your data.frame to a character vector and then only deal with factors when and if you choose to. Many regression models will convert characters to factors automatically, but ordering of the factors is something you may need to do manually to ensure they are ordered logically. 

```{r}
# converting from factor to character using as.character()
class(mydataframe$colors)

mydataframe$colors <- as.character(mydataframe$colors)
class(mydataframe$colors)
```

#### Lists

Back on the topic of data structure. The third base-R structure for holding data is a 'list' object.  This structure is basically a container structure for holding other things.  The list can contain single data points, vectors, matrices, and data frames together, all in one object.  This can be handy for keeping yourself organized, and also handy if you wish to create a function that returns a bunch of different things.


```{r}
mylist<-list(myvector,mymatrix,mydataframe)
print(mylist)
```


Individual elements within a list can be accessed through double-square brackets.


```{r}
print(mylist[[2]])
```


Or, if there are names assigned to the element of the list, they can be accessed through the '$' method, or through the names within double-square brackets.


```{r}
names(mylist)<-c("one","two","three")
mylist$one
mylist[["two"]]
```
