Although tidyverse is a wonderful framework for data management, and is important to learn, you will likely encounter code written by dinosaurs, like Emilie, who learned to code in R before the existence of tidyverse.

This segment is aimed at giving you some tools that may come in handy for understanding code written by other people.  This type of coding is also useful for simple data-management problems.
  
## Data summaries - Part 1 -- rows and columns
### apply for row/column summaries
Sometimes, you will want to summarize data over the rows and columns in a matrix, or data frame.  R's 'apply' function is built for this purpose. 
```{r}
mymatrix<-matrix(c(1,1,1,2,2,2,3,4,5),nrow = 3, byrow = T)
mymatrix
```

For example, to extract the average of each row in a matrix, you can use the apply function, specifying the first dimension.
```{r}
apply(mymatrix,1,mean)
```

To extract the average of each column, simply specify the second dimension.
```{r}
apply(mymatrix,2,mean)
```

It is easy to create different summaries by changing out the function specified in the third argument to the function call.

```{r}
apply(mymatrix,2,sum)
```

It is also possible to use a function that returns multiple values.
```{r}
apply(mymatrix,2,summary)
```

## Data subsetting
Sometimes, you will not want to perform a summary over all of your data.  In this case, you can subset objects with vectors.  These vectors. 

In the introductory script, we illustrated how to subset a matrix with numbers indicating which rows and columns to choose.

```{r}
mymatrix[c(1,3),c(1,2)]
```

We can subset with other types of information as well. True/false 
### Subsetting with true and false vectors
#### Boolean commands: a quick intro.
Boolean commands in R are useful for creating true/false vectors to use in subsetting. 

First, we'll start off with two simple vectors of numbers.
```{r}
x<-1:11
y<-11:1
x
y
```

We can use basic boolean notation to apply logical conditions to our vectors. Here are a few simple examples with ==, !=, >, >=, and %in%. 
```{r}
x == y
x != y
x > 2
x >= y
x %in% y
```

Boolean statements can be combined too.
```{r}
(x >= y) & (x != y)
(x >= y) | (x != y)
```

#### functions that return boolean results
The two functions 'is.na', and 'is.null' are both useful in some circumstances, especially when filtering data sets to show only observations with no missing values.
```{r}
z<-c(NA,1,2,3)
is.na(z)
```

```{r}
p<-NULL
is.null(p)
```

The 'any', and 'all' functions are also quite handy.

#### Putting it all togehter: subsetting with boolean vectors
Suppose we had a data set (matrix), which had one missing value in one row.
```{r}
mymatrix<-matrix(c(NA,1,1,2,3,1,1,2,3,1,1,5),nrow = 4)
mymatrix

```


Suppose we want to do an analysis which can't handle data with missing values.

We can create our own little function to use within within apply, which will create a vector that we can use to subset the rows in the matrix.

```{r}
navector<-apply(mymatrix,1,function(x){!any(is.na(x))})
## English translation of the function: "Not any of these values in this row of mymatrix contain NA values"
navector
mymatrix[navector,]
```

### Subsetting with names
Sometimes, your data have names.  These can also be handy handles to use for grabbing portions of data objects.
```{r}

```
## Data summaries - Part 2 -- Summaries over groups
### tapply for summaries over groups
### split/lapply for large problems.
